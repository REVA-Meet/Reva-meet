# Reva-meet
Organise and register for events in one go
## 
With over 130+ clubs and associations at REVA University, webinars, workshops, and other
activities being conducted nearly every day, it can be cumbersome to organize, promote and
conduct these events smoothly.
These events/workshops/classes conducted would provide student attendees the opportunity
to learn a new skill or get accustomed to a software/hardware. This initiative encourages
students to follow a “learn by doing” approach with hands-on-workshops, ultimately making
them industry ready, and up-to date with the latest technologies.
REVA Meets is a university-based mobile application developed for the purpose of creating a
shared social network for announcements and promotions of events and encouraging active
involvement of students for the activities hosted.
# How it works
It'll provide a common social network for both announcements and participation in
events and workshops conducted at our university.

Teachers will have the facility to easily book auditoriums/seminar halls/classrooms or
the amphitheater and will have access to a common working schedule to avoid clashing
of the events.

The Students will have access to every workshop/classes being conducted.
